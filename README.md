INTRODUCTION

This repository contains a data science project aimed and analyzing the car prediction  rate using python. The price of a car depends on a lot of faciors like the goodwill of the brand of the caà¦¾ features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.
